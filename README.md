# Capstone Project - by Dhruv Tuteja (README)

The accompanying Capstone project takes a raw Lending Club dataset and creates 2 models - a random forest model and a neural network model. 
The performance of these models is then evaluated and compared before finally giving a conclusion.
Both of the models are multi-class classification models and aim to predict loan status class membership of loan applicants.
